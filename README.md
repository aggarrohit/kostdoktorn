# About

This app is created as a sample to show recipes list with few fields.<br>
This app also has code to run graphql APIs via Apollo but due to lack of required fields in the json data, sample modified data is used.<br>
This app is tested over android only due to resource limitations.<br>

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

# using npm

npm start

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

# using npm

npm run android

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
